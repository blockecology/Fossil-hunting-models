# Fossil-hunting-models
This repository contains the code used for the paper Block et al. "Where to dig for fossils? Combining climate-envelope, taphonomy, and discovery models". <br>

The pdf file "Workflow" illustrates how each of these scripts interact with data files and with each other to create the figures and tables we present in the paper. <br>
